# Label Studio Util

## Overview

This repository contains a utility script to assist in uploading local files to a Label Studio project. Specifically, it aims to solve the problem where both Label Studio and the files to be annotated are on the same machine. 

Suppose you have a Label Studio project hosted on a machine and you have a folder containing `.png` files on the same machine that you wish to get annotated. Uploading these files manually through the Label Studio interface can be cumbersome.

## Requirements

- Label Studio
- Shell access to the machine where Label Studio is hosted

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script with the necessary arguments:

    ```sh
    chmod +x upload_local_files.sh
    ./upload_local_files -h 
    ./upload_local_files.sh IP_ADDRESS IMAGE_DIRECTORY WILDCARD FILE_PORT LS_PORT OUTPUT_FILE
    ```

3. Go to your Label Studio Web UI, and use the upload feature to import the output file generated by the script.

By using this utility, you can easily streamline the process of getting your local files into Label Studio for annotation.
